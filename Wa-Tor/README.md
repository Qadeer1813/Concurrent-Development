Before running or compiling the Wa-tor simulation make sure that 
[Fyne](https://docs.fyne.io/started/) is set up correctly.

    To compile go code
        1. go run Wa-tor.go

**What is Wa-tor**

    Wa-Tor is a population dynamics simulation devised by A. K. Dewdney and 
    presented in the December 1984 issue of Scientific American in a five-page 
    article entitled "Computer Recreations: Sharks and fish wage an ecological 
    war on the toroidal planet Wa-Tor".

**Implementation**

    The Development of the WA-TOR simulastion started with a sequential implmentation
    and then moved to a more complex version concurrent version.

    1. Sequential Implmentation
    Straightforward sequential version of the Wa-Tor simulation, 
    focusing on creating the core functionality

    2. Concurrent Implmentation
    After the completion of the sequential implementation, concurrency was introduced

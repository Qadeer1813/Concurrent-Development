# Lab 5 Producer Consumer

For running program and to see the license please refer to https://github.com/Qadeer1813/Concurrent-Development/blob/main/README.md 

This Go program implements a producer-consumer scenario where multiple producers generate a fixed number of items and send them to a shared buffer then consumer processes these items and this runs preventing any deadlock
